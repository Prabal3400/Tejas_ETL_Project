3 - Validation Checks

For Duplicates:

No duplicate Customer_Id exists in the staging table or when moving to country tables.
Date Validations:

Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, and DOB should be valid dates.
Ensure Last_Consulted_Date is not greater than the current date.
Active Customer Check:

If Is_Active is 'N', consider not inserting into the country tables or handle according to business rules.
Mandatory Fields Validation:

All mandatory fields (Customer_Name, Customer_Id, Open_Date, etc.) are populated before processing.
Age and Days Since Last Consulted Calculations:

Validate that age and days since last consulted are computed correctly and are within logical bounds (e.g., age cannot be negative).
